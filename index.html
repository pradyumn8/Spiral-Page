                <p>Older adults want to play active and meaningful roles in their lives, including as part of a social
                    network, a neighborhood, and a community. Service providers and policymakers must consider that a
                    lack of sense of purpose can become problematic as people age. Engaging them in leisure activities
                    and volunteer work is important.</p>

                <p>Older adults want to stay active and contribute to society in a reciprocal manner (meaning that they
                    want to exchange their services and skills with others for the mutual benefit of the neighborhood or
                    community). Qualitative and quantitative studies published from 2005 to 2016 examining the social
                    needs of older adults were eligible for inclusion.</p>

                <p>To stimulate social contacts, neighborhood initiatives can be developed. Social meeting places, such
                    as pubs and churches can help to foster the development of close and peripheral relationships.</p>

            <p>Loneliness and social isolation are growing public health concerns in our aging society. Whilst these
                experiences occur across the life span, 50% of individuals aged over 60 are at risk of social isolation
                and one-third will experience some degree of loneliness later in life. It is vital to reduce loneliness
                and social isolation among older adults.</p>

            <p>The methodology framework proposed by Asked and O’Malley and further developed by Levac, et al. was used
                to guide the scoping review process. A total of 33 reviews met the inclusion criteria, evaluating a
                range of interventions targeted at older people residing in the community or institutionalised settings.
